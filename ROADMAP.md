# Roadmap

## 1.1.0
In this version, the URL structure should be adjusted to allow greater flexibility in parameter handling. Additionally, caching should be provided.

## 1.0.4
The extension variables `imageStepWidth` should be integrated. This will allow users to specify the increments in which images are generated. The caching from version 1.1.0 should be carried over, along with the steps.

## 1.0.5
A `JSON` response is still needed to enable users to obtain the file URL directly in the frontend if they do not wish to use the API URL. This could easily be facilitated through a query parameter.
